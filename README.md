# Tic Tac Toe

This is my Tic Tac Toe console game.

## Instructions:
1. `git clone https://github.com/ctsexton/tictactoe.git && cd tictactoe`
2. `python main.py`

Requires Python 3.

In main.py you have the option to change the players (human or computer) and board size (including non-square sizes) and the game should still work. However, computer players on board sizes larger than 3x3 will take a **long** time to choose moves. So it is only recommended to play with humans with larger board sizes. You can also pit two computer players against one another, but they will always reach a tie.
